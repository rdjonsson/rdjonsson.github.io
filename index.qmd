Various writings on transport systems analysis and loosely related topics.



## Current activity
I am a research scientist at the division of Systems Analysis and Economics, department of Urban Planning and Environment, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm.

Since 2018 – KTH Partner director for the Strategic Partnership between KTH and Region Stockholm regarding transport and regional planning.

Since 2022 – KTH Partner contact EIT Urban Mobility, an initiative of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT).

If there was such a field as Complexity Regional Science I would probably be working in it.
